{"name":"Monitask","tagline":"simple, compact and flexible system monitoring tool","body":"# Monitask\r\n\r\nMonitask is a simple, compact and flexible monitoring solution inspired by RRD and Munin tools and developed to minimize\r\nthe load when configuring, collecting and displaying system health metrics.\r\n\r\n## Simple\r\n\r\nAll configuration is done via .INI files. Commands sections provide shell commands that allow to collect system metrics.\r\nDisplay sections explain how to interpret metrics and display them on graphs.\r\n\r\n## Compact\r\n\r\nHaving a minimal footprint, Monitask does not need additional tools on your server to generate interactive graphs\r\nrepresenting your server activity.\r\n\r\nRound-robin database concept is used to register server activity in a simple text CSV file. With default settings,\r\ntracking activity for 20 metrics and 4 periods (by day, week, month and year) only takes about 3.5MB of disk space.\r\n\r\n## Flexible\r\n\r\nMonitask is designed from the start so that storage and display be easily extended via plugins. This allows storing\r\nmetrics data on virtually any support, like in plain-text file, a compressed file, in a database or another support.\r\nResults may be output in text mode, on an HTML page with interactive graphs or in any other form.\r\n\r\nSince platforms and architectures may vary, default commands and configurations may be rewritten by platform-specific\r\n.INI files.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nFor installation and configuration instructions please see our wiki [documentation].\r\n\r\n[documentation]: https://github.com/dotgit/monitask/wiki/\r\n","google":"UA-41832429-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
